DESCRIPTION

  Convert IRC channel's logs to web format

  See `./irssi-log-split.sh --help` for more details

HOW IT WORKS

  See `Makefile::daily` and `make default`. The steps are

    - download the big log file from the bot server
    - split the log file into parts (actually, only get yesterday logs)
    - filter the logs and transform the log files into readable format
    - upload the output to remote servers

REQUIREMENTS

  The irssi settings must use a special timestamp format. In `irss`, try
              /SET log_timestamp = %Y-%m-%d %H:%S

  (You should include an extra space at the end of the command.)
